Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC

**Task Description**\
Subjects performed two auditory tasks during three different recording sessions (three different days; Figure 1A). The first task involved a simple pitch judgment (‘‘Simple Task,’’ detection of a local pitch change in a delayed-matched-to-sample task); the second task used the same stimuli and relative timing but required the manipulation of auditory information (‘‘Manipulation task,’’ in which the listener must identify a local pitch change in two patterns that differ in temporal order. Participants performed the auditory tasks during a simultaneous MEG/EEG recording.

**Participant categories**\
Seventeen neurologically healthy young adults (five women; mean age, 28.12 ± 3.86 years, ranging from 21 to 33; mean education, 18.29 ± 2.59 years; mean musical training 6.7 years ± 7.03 years, ranging from 0 to 19) participated in the study. The group was composed of sixteen right-handed participants and one left-handed participant. All participants reported normal hearing and no history of neurological or psychiatric disease.
